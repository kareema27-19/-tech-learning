 Web-development.
Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet.

The Frontend section in web development refers to the part of a website or web application that the user sees and interacts with directly.

The Backend section (also called server-side) is the part of a website or web application that users do NOT see, but it makes everything work behind the scenes.

The Database section in web development refers to the part of the system that is responsible for storing, organizing, and managing data so that the backend can use it.
